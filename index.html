                        <p>

 
If Mat Belcher and Will Ryan are feeling the tremendous pressure of expectation, they certainly don’t show it. Fresh from their outstanding victory in Israel only last month, the pair were once again out front of the competition, this time in Abu Dhabi where the Queenslanders wrapped up the 2015 ISAF Sailing World Cup Final.</p>
 <p>
Successfully defending their 2014 title, the pair started in fine style with a win in round one to take the lead – a position they retained throughout the regatta. Sailing consistently, they built a steady lead which saw them enter the final medal race a cool seven points in front of nearest rivals, Anton Dahlberg and Fredrik Bergström from Sweden. Here, another race win wrapped it up for the Australians to build on their extraordinary record of results that have seen them finish on the podium at every regatta they have competed in since teaming up after the London Olympics – where of course Belcher and former team mate Malcolm Page won the Gold Medal. </p>
<p> 
Far from being complacent though, the champion yachtsmen take every opportunity to evacuate their performance and along with their coach, Victor Kovalenko, look at ways to hone their skills even further and build on their incredible team work.</p>

            <h2>Looking to Rio</h2>
            <p>
Belcher described the conditions in Abu Dhabi as tricky, but took great satisfaction in winning the event once again.
“The racing has been close, and it was an exciting medal race with a lot to fight for,” he said after the event.
</p>
<p>
 
“We made a few mistakes on the first leg and rounded in last but there were plenty of opportunities to come back. I’m really happy for us to end the season off on a high and even though we had a small fleet the competition was tough.”
 </p>
<p>
"We feel quite strongly about the ISAF Sailing World Cup and wanted to come here to support the event. Quite a few of our competitors wanted some rest after competing in our Worlds Championships a few weeks back but we felt it important to come here and show our support not only for the class but also ISAF and the World Cup concept,” Belcher added.
 </p>
<p>
Crew Will Ryan shared Mat’s view on the regatta, saying:
 </p>
<p>
“It has been a tough event with difficult timing straight after the Worlds. But a lot of effort is put into making this a good event, and it is a pretty special place to visit and sail, for sure something we will remember in years to come.”
 </p>
<p>
“Next up for us we are all looking forward to a bit of a break and getting back home after a few busy months. We have had the chance to identify plenty of things to work on over this coming 10 months though and we will be full noise from now on to the Games I'm sure.”
 </p>
<p>
But that break back home will be short lived, as the pair will then head for Rio in December to compete in the 2015 Copa Brazil de Vela and another chance to gain precious training time at the Olympic Games venue.
 </p>
<p>
The countdown is well and truly on.
